- It lets you perform side effects in function components<br>
- It is used to manage the side effects <br>
- Examples of side effects:
  - Data fetching
  - Setting up subscription
  - Manually changing DOM in react components
- Think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined together into one function
  - So previously we would have to duplicate the code in all those 3 lifecycle hooks
  - This is solved with useEffect
