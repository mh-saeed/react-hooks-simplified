## UseState Hook Info <a name="1"></a>

- useState hook gives us local state in a function component.
- You can simply use React.useState() or Just import useState from react.
- The useState hook returns an array with two entries.

  - The `1st` entry in the array is the current state while.
  - The `2nd` entry is the method which allows us to update the state.

- It takes in initial state data as a parameter in useState() <br>

`Example:`

    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

## React Hook Rules <a name="2"></a>

    if (true) {
        const [state, setState] = useState("hello world!");
    }

丘멆잺 This code will give error: React Hook "useState" is called conditionally

`Reason:`
React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render
that means we can not call any react hook in if statements or functions,
or inside of loops, they can not be nested in any thing, the must be at the
top level of functional component.

## Initial State Computation <a name="3"></a>

Sometimes it is slow to compute the initial state of a component.
This is not a problem in class components since the initial state
computation only happens once in the constructor, but in functional
components the initial state computation is declared in the render
function and happens every render.

Having a slow initial state computation (Multiple Renders 游댮)
can slow down an entire application significantly because of this.

    useState( Slow computation )

`Example:`

    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
                    OR
    const [count, setCount] = useState(countInitial());

If we set the default value of useState by passing the value directly
to the useState constructor then whenever the component get's rendered,
the value/state of useState will be the default passed value

Slow initial state computation - Multiple Renders Solution 游릭

    useState(() => {
        Slow computation
    })

`Example:`

    const [count, setCount] = useState(()=>{
        console.log("Run ...")
        return 0
    });

useState can also take a function as the argument instead of a value,
and that function will only be run the very first time a component is rendered.
By using this function version of useState you will no longer run the
slow computation each render, but only once on the first render of the
component just like class components.

## Wrong Way Of Using Hook 游댮 <a name="4"></a>

    setCount(count-1)

This is incorrect way to update value of useState based on previous value because
if call setCount two times in a row it will just update the value at once

`Example:`

    function increment() {
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
    }

## Correct Way Of Using Hook 游릭 <a name="5"></a>

Instead use the below way for updating state.

    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);

It will take the previous State as an argument and then it will update the current state

`Example:`

    function increment() {
        setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    }

## Updating State Objects <a name="6"></a>

Most of the time we use single values with useState,
but there are some cases where using an object makes more sense.
Let's just use the example of user preferences.

    const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({
        theme: 'light',
        fontSize: 'normal
    '})

To update the theme portion of this state we may think to do something like this.

    setPreferences({ theme: 'dark' }) // WRONG WAY 游댮

This code will update the entire preferences object to be just { theme: 'dark' }
without any fontSize.

This is because the set method from useState will overwrite the entire value
of the state with the new value, so the new value of { theme: 'dark' } overwrites
all of the old state.

In order to make sure this does not happen you would need to combine the
old state with the new state manually.

This code will combine all the old preferences
with the new dark theme preference. - CORRECT WAY 游릭

    setPreferences(prevPreferences => {
        return { ...prevPreferences, theme: 'dark' }
    })

`Example:`

    const [state, setState] = useState ({ count: 4, theme: "blue ' })

    function decrementCount (){
        setState(prevState => {
        return { ...prevState, count: prevState.count - 1 }
    }

## Using Multiple useState Hooks - Another Way 游릭 <a name="7"></a>

Function components can use multiple useState hooks inside one component
it is much more common to have an individual useState hook for each piece of state.
This is as simple as having multiple useState hooks one after another.

If you don't want to use object for storing multiple/different types of state
you can use multiple useState hook to store different types of states.
this is the biggest advantage of useState hook.

`Example:`

    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState(dark);

It makes sure each part of our state has its own name and update function
which makes handling state much easier.
